# Web-Audio-API-Tutorial

Various simple Web Audio API examples

They demonstrate almost all the audio nodes with short, working examples. The aim of these tutorials is to give very short but still fully functional examples for those trying to learn the WAA but not spend a long amount of time dissecting larger code samples, or understanding code snippets without their context. The examples are roughly ordered sequentially to cover the simplest Hello World to nodes that use more audio or WAA concepts.

After the 15 node examples, there are also short examples of Beep Sounds, FM Synthesis, AM Synthesis, Bell Sounds and the Karplus Strong algorithm.

For those who came here from the AES 148 tutorial on 'Procedural Audio and the Web Audio API', examples given in the tutorial include 'Hello World', 'Gain Node - User Interaction', 'Beep', 'Worklets' and 'Bells'
